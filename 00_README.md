# inspirit-AI
includes all the work and code I did in my first machine learning course

The text of the notebooks were made by inspirit AI, but most of the code was left blank for the students to do

the final notebook can't be put into this project, it relied too heavily on code from a package that no longer exists (this was one of the few pieces of provied code, so it will take more time for me to fix), this is why 09 is missing
